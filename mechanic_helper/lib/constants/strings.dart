//Service category descriptions
const String oilChangeDescription ='An Oil Change is the act of removing the used oil in your engine and replacing it with new, clean oil. Over time, oil breaks down and gets dirty. These factors make oil much less slippery and less effective at their job of lubricating engine parts.';
const String tireReplacementDescription ="Replacement tires are any other tire, which may be purchased thereafter. ... Replacement may be necessary due to wear or the age of OE tires. Or you may decide that you would like a new tire that delivers more of a particular feature. An OE tire isn't necessarily an average tire.";
const String batteryReplacementDescription ="No battery can last forever. General wisdom says you should replace your car battery about every three years, but you could end up needing a replacement sooner. Factors like your climate and driving habits can affect your battery's lifespan and leave you needing a new one before the three-year mark.";
const String brakeRepairDescription ="Auto brake repair is the repair or replacement of auto brake parts, which may include the brake pads, rotors or calipers. ... Auto brake repair is about helping people keep their brakes in quality condition, which in return helps drivers stay safe and get the most out of their vehicle.";
const String wheelBalanceDescription ="Wheel Balancing ensures that the tires and wheels spin correctly and without vibration. Balancing is accomplished by checking for any heavy spots on the wheel and or tire and making allowances for it by placing weights in specific spots on the wheel.";
const String gearboxServiceDescription ="A transmission service is a regular part of routine car maintenance, just like an oil change. The primary aspect of a transmission service is flushing out the old transmission fluid and replacing it with new fluid.";
const String suspensionServiceDescription ="Suspension of service means an arrangement made at the initiative of the TSP for temporarily discontinuing service without terminating the contract or removing the telephone service from the customer's premises. ... Suspension of service means installing a lock temporarily on the meter.";
const String carCheckDescription ="A car service can involve up to 50 or more components, systems checks and adjustments including: An engine oil change and/or filter replacement. Checking lights, tyres, exhaust and operations of brakes and steering. Ensuring your engine is 'tuned' to run in its peak condition.";
